#  Flask Backend – Intrusion Detection System API

This is the backend service for the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project, built with **Flask**. It provides a REST API for uploading network traffic files, preprocessing the data, running inference with a machine learning model, and returning the classification results.

---

##  Features

- Accepts CSV file uploads for intrusion detection
- Preprocesses input using trained encoders and scalers
- Runs inference using a pre-trained model
- Returns predictions with charts encoded in base64
- CORS configured for integration with frontend
- Containerized for deployment on AWS ECS Fargate
- Integrated into a multi-environment CI/CD pipeline
